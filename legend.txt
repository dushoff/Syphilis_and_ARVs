A susceptible-infective-treated model of HIV and T. pallidum epidemiology predicts that both ARV and behavior change substantially boost syphilis prevalence above baseline. The model used two risk groups and assortative mixing between groups. Using baseline parameters from the literature (23), we varied parameters quantifying ARV effects and partnership formation rates on susceptibility to and transmission of T. pallidum. We introduced ARVs at 20y and plotted syphilis prevalence without (left panel) and with (right panel) a three-fold effect of ARVs on susceptibility to T. pallidum, under different assumptions about the effect of ARVs on partnership formation rates (see Appendix for more details). Compared to the baseline of no effect (left panel, black line), the combined effect of increased susceptibility and behaviour change (right panel, colored lines) is larger than the sum of the effects of behaviour change alone (left panel, colored lines) and increased susceptibility alone (right panel, colored lines).
