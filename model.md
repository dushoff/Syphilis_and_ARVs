Structure
=========

(SI for syphilis)
× (SIT for HIV)
× (two risk groups)
× (one gender)

Features
========

* Treated people with syphilis become S

* Treated people with HIV go to class T, and become more susceptible to syphilis (biologically). Are they also having more sex because they are not a danger to partners?

* Assortative mixing between risk groups

Mixing
======

This seems like a big can of worms. We definitely want risk-group assortativity, but the HIV category questions are hurting my head. Bob thinks we should not worry about it (although it was also kind of his suggestion in the first place).

Incidence function
------------------

* General incidence is: T = β(N) SI/N

* Standard incidence is the special case of β(N) = β₀

* Mass-action incidence is the special case of β(N) = β₁N

Start with standard incidence (individual sexual mixing rate is not directly affected by population size). Pay attention to whether our population is changing dramatically.

Assortativity
-------------

We will start with "preferred mixing", this means that a proportion ρ of an individual's mixing is reserved for their own risk group, and the rest is used randomly in the whole population. 

See Grassly equation 1 (or the old Dushoff paper if it helps clarify)

We want to address the assumption about how _transmissible_ infections are as well (need to review syphilis/HIV interaction information)

Infection process
-----------------

The rate at which susceptibles in group i get infected would then be

β(N) L_i S_i
